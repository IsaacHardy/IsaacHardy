## 🧭 Leadership Philosophy

I'm passionate about building high-trust teams shaped by humility, servanthood, and unity. I see leadership as discipleship—walking alongside others, multiplying impact, and modeling what it means to serve faithfully in every role. My technical leadership draws from biblical patterns, servant leadership models, and a Kingdom-first mindset.

🕊 “That, in the opinion of the world, others may increase and I may decrease.”
